**Customer Churn Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**

**Overview**

This project builds a deep learning model using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict customer churn. It is implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook and leverages deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow/Keras.

**Features**

1. Data preprocessing and feature engineering

2. ANN model architecture with input, hidden, and output layer

3. Model training and evaluation using accuracy and loss metrics

4. Predictions and insights for business decision-making

**Installation**

**1. Clone the repository:**

git clone https://github.com/your-username/Customer-Churn-Prediction-ANN.git

**2. Install dependencies:**

pip install -r requirements.txt

**3. Usage**

Run the Jupyter Notebook to execute the steps for data processing, model training, and prediction:


jupyter notebook Customer_Churn_Prediction_ANN.ipynb

**Results**

1. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

2. Visualization of training loss and accuracy

3. Business insights on customer churn behavior
